## Discord Plane Simulation Bot
PlanePal is a Discord bot designed for controlling and managing virtual planes within the Discord platform. It allows users to engage in various activities, such as purchasing and upgrading planes to enhance take-offs and landings, ultimately earning more in-game currency. Users can also hire plane crews to improve their flight experience, buy temporary boosts or potions for a cash boost, and hire pilots to reduce the risk of crashes.

In addition, owning a better plane increases the chances of attracting VIP guests, leading to higher earnings for each flight. Users can also establish a flight school within the bot, where they can teach virtual flight students, hire staff and teachers, and upgrade facilities to generate additional in-game currency
